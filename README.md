## About
That's an incomplete list of web3 Twitter accounts 
that might be useful for a beginner in the space. 

These people/organizations live in the web3 and are
deeply connected with other content creators in the industry. 

Some of them tweet useful materials, some of them publish their essays, and some of them like and retweet those who share knowledge.

The list is initially based on my followings and wildly lacks great authors whom I don't know. 
I am sure it might be an infinite list, but these are the only accounts I enjoy by myself.
